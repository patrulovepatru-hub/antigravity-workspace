## NEW DISCOVERY: Dual WAF Protection

### Primary WAF: Cloudflare
- Standard Cloudflare protection
- Bot management via __cf_bm cookie

### Secondary WAF: "Zero WAF"  [IMPORTANT]
- Custom header: zero: zero-waf
- Request ID: zero-id: 013db76999dffffba652683ba8cbb836-d56d6
- This is an additional layer of protection beyond Cloudflare
- Likely custom application firewall

## Open Ports

| Port | Service | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| 80   | HTTP    | Redirects to HTTPS |
| 443  | HTTPS   | Main web application |
| 8080 | HTTP    | Redirects to HTTPS (alternate port) |
| 8443 | HTTPS   | Returns text/plain (15 bytes) - Potential API/Internal |

## Port 8443 Analysis [INTERESTING]
- Different response type: text/plain vs text/html
- Only 15 bytes content - likely "error" or "unauthorized"
- X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN (only on 8443, not main site!)
- Could be internal service exposed
- Worth investigating further

## Technology Confirmation
- jQuery 3.6.1
- Cloudflare CDN/WAF
- Zero WAF (secondary)
- HSTS enabled (180 days)
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block

## Potential Attack Vectors

1. **Bypass Zero WAF** - Less documented than Cloudflare, might have gaps
2. **Port 8443** - Non-standard service, could have different protections
3. **WebSocket (ws.key-drop.com)** - Real-time comms often less protected
4. **IDOR on user profiles** - /user/profile/* blocked in robots.txt
5. **Missing CSP** - XSS potential if injection point found
