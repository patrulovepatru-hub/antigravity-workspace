## Potential Vulnerabilities

### IDOR Candidates (test with different IDs)
- /CaseBattle/gameFullData/:id
- /CaseBattle/cloneBattle/:id
- /CaseBattle/sell-all/:id  <-- CRITICAL if exploitable
- /CaseBattle/leaveBattle/:id

### Auth Bypass Candidates
- /CaseBattle/joinBot/:gameId
- /v2/battle/joinRandomBots/:gameId

### Business Logic
- Can you clone someone else's battle?
- Can you sell items from someone else's game?
- Can you leave/manipulate someone else's battle?
