# Collected: 2026-01-07

## HIGH RISK

### 1. Missing X-Frame-Options Header
- Risk: Clickjacking attacks possible
- Impact: Users could be tricked into clicking hidden elements
- Affected: Main site (/)
- Remediation: Add "X-Frame-Options: DENY" or "SAMEORIGIN"

### 2. Insecure Cookie: key-lang
- Missing: Secure flag
- Missing: HttpOnly flag
- Risk: Cookie can be stolen via XSS, transmitted over HTTP
- Impact: Session hijacking potential

### 3. BREACH Attack Potential
- Content-Encoding: deflate enabled
- Risk: SSL/TLS secrets could be extracted if CSRF tokens in compressed responses
- Reference: http://breachattack.com/

## MEDIUM RISK

### 4. Missing Content-Security-Policy
- Risk: XSS attacks not mitigated by browser
- Impact: If injection found, full JavaScript execution possible

### 5. Zero WAF Information Disclosure
- Headers expose: zero: zero-waf, zero-id: [request-id]
- Risk: Attacker knows secondary WAF type
- Can research specific bypasses for this WAF

## LOW RISK

### 6. IP in Cookie (1.0.1.1)
- Found in __cf_bm cookie
- Likely Cloudflare WARP IP, not internal
- Minor information disclosure

### 7. HTTP/3 Advertising
- alt-svc header advertising QUIC
- Not a vulnerability, but may have different behavior

## SSL/TLS Information
- Certificate: CN=key-drop.com
- Issuer: Google Trust Services (WE1)
- Cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (Strong)

## Interesting Paths Found
- /clientaccesspolicy.xml (Silverlight cross-domain policy)
- /robots.txt (24 entries)
- /cgi-local/ (triggers different headers)
- /admin.nsf (returns Cloudflare challenge)
